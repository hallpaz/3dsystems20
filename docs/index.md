# 3D Graphics Systems Course - IMPA 2020

## Assignment 1 - Exploring PyTorch3D library

The objective of this assignment is to get familiarized with tha AI graphics platform [Pytorch3D](https://pytorch3d.org/). To achieve this, I read though the available [documentation](https://pytorch3d.org/docs/why_pytorch3d) and [tutorials](https://pytorch3d.org/tutorials/0) and started doing some experiments focused on 3D modeling topic.


### Creating primitives with PyTorch3D

PyTorch3D was designed to work with 3D meshes.
