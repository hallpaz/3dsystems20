## When AI renders a new Perspective in Graphics

This project builds on the previous assignments of 3D modeling and scene visualization using PyTorch3D, one of the AI graphics platforms available for free. 

> Our goal is to_Render a panoramic scene using a differentiable
> renderer and exploit the inverse rendering to augment a scene.

Most of the experiments can be found in the [rendering](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1ggdaF0OFeAm9CTC1ZXiQFUnNxdgrrRWH?usp=sharing) or [de-rendering](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/16393ggQ6bzDhjda7pMBoMOAFluPzRSL-?usp=sharing) Google Colab notebooks. You can [download full results here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1IUPjgpALrnlfuBMZir779LogZt2_ZxAR?usp=sharing).

### Motivation
-   ✓AI Graphics
-   ✓Past works… panoramas!
Previous works studying how we could use panoramic images for experiences in augmented or virtual reality.

-   ✓Future perspectives on panoramas (VR | AR | XR)
Recently 
Rendering, or more specifically diferrentiable rendering, looks like a good topic to relate these areas.

### Differentiable Rendering

### Experiments and Analysis


### Conclusion and next steps

-   ✓Parameterize rotations (quaternions?)
-   ✓Render new objects in panoramic environment
