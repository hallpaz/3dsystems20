## When AI renders a new Perspective in Graphics

This project builds on... _Render a panoramic scene using a differentiable renderer and exploit the inverse rendering to augment a scene_
The objective of this 2nd assignment is to render a scene using the differentiable renderer implemented in PyTorch3D and exploit some capabilities of this system. We aim to render equirectangular panoramas, building a scene with a single sphere parameterized by latitude and longitude and setting the camera in the center of the sphere. You can find the [full source code here](https://github.com/hallpaz/3dsystems20/blob/master/Rendering%20Panoramas.ipynb).

### Motivation
-   ✓AI Graphics
-   ✓Past works… panoramas!
-   ✓Future perspectives on panoramas (VR | AR | XR)
-   ✓Rendering looks like a good topic to relate these areas

### Differentiable Rendering

### Experiments and Analysis


### Conclusion and next steps

-   ✓Parameterize rotations (quaternions?)
-   ✓Render new objects in panoramic environment
