## When AI renders a new Perspective in Graphics


The objective of this 2nd assignment is to render a scene using the differentiable renderer implemented in PyTorch3D and exploit some capabilities of this system. We aim to render equirectangular panoramas, building a scene with a single sphere parameterized by latitude and longitude and setting the camera in the center of the sphere. You can find the [full source code here](https://github.com/hallpaz/3dsystems20/blob/master/Rendering%20Panoramas.ipynb).
