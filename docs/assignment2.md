## Assignment 2 - Rendering a Scene with a Differentiable Renderer

The objective of this assignment is to render a scene using a differentiable renderer and exploit some capabilities of this system. We aim to render equirectangular panoramas, building a scene with a single sphere parameterized by latitude and longitude and setting the c√¢mera in the center of the sphere.

### Modeling the Scene

First of all, we need to compute the geometry and texture coordinates for a sphere. We decided to use an equirectangular panorama as a bidimensional texture for the interior of the sphere, so it seems easier to parameterize the sphere in terms of latitude and longitude coordinates.

For the geometry, we sample points uniformly as we increment the angles Phi and Theta in a spherical coordinate system. 0 <= Phi < 2pi; 0 <= Theta < pi. As the texture has a boundary and the sphere has not , we must be careful to achieve a good and meaningful result. Our strategy for a good mapping was:

1. We don't close the sphere in the poles. We keep the vertice
