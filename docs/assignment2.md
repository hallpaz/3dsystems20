## Assignment 2 - Rendering a Scene with a Differentiable Renderer

The objective of this assignment is to render a scene using a differentiable renderer and exploit some capabilities of this system. We aim to render equirrectangular panoramas, building a scene with a single sphere parameterized by latitude and longitude and setting the c√¢mera in the center of the sphere.

### Modeling the Scene

First of all, we need to compute the geometry and texture coordinates for a sphere. We decided to use an equirrectangular panorama as a bidimensional texture for the interior of the sphere, so
